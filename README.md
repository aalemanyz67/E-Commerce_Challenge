# Objective:
Using MySql Workbenc, Insomina, and and VS Code, I was able to build the back end of a e-commerce site. I used a working Express.js API to Sequelize data inot Mysql database to demonstrate the different api routes that I created.

# Description:
This video will demonstrate how the back end application was built for an e-commerce site. I will also demonstrate the different API routes that I created for this back end application.

# Installation:
This challenge does not need installation since there is a demovideo. Link is at the top of my README file.

# Usage
This type of application can be used for any buisness or website that envolves retail.

# Future Improvements
I did have some issues with my product api routes and therefore I look to correct those so that they work efficiently and correctly.
